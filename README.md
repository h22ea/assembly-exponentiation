## Summary
A little project I made in my first year of college.
It's the exponentiation process implemented in assembly.

## How it works
The main idea behind is the continous addition of values in order to simulate the multiplication process. The registers are used to store numeric data.

## Points of improvement
- few registers usage
- new logic for the multiplication process
